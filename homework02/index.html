	   <h3>Miami Florida</h3>
	   <p>My latest great trip experience was trip to Miami Florida. My friend and I decided to visit during the week Art Basel event which place took in December. 
          A little bit about Art Basel. More than 200 of the world's leading Modern and contemporary art galleries – from North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia – display paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations, prints, photography, film, video, and digital art by over 4,000 artists. 
          Art Basel is world-class art museums, painting, sculptures and a glittering nightlife. People come from all over the world to explore the many dimensions of modern and contemporary art.  Also we have visited many restaurants but my favorite place was “Tequila Chic’s”. 
          We were going almost every day there for lunch, great patio, big menu choice, delicious food  and affordable prices. If you are in Miami by chance I would recommend you to visit that place. 
          In a few words, Loved Miami, beautiful beaches, nice people, great food, and many things to do begin from day to night time.</p>

     </video>
     
     <p>Using helpful resources <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">www.w3schools.com</a> I would like to share some video from Magic Kindgom that I capture when I was there with my friend by using new HTML &lt;video> tag. 
          All browsers versions fully supports the &lt;video> element.</p>
       <p>How it works? The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume. Also you can include width and height attributes. Awesome!</p>
     <p>By default, the &lt;audio> and &lt;video> element controls are determined by each browser independently. Depending on the design of a website, more authority over the look and feel of the media player may be needed. If this is the case, a customized player can be built, but it will require a little JavaScript to work.</p>

	   <h3>&lt;mark></h3>
	  <p>The &lt;mark> Element represents highlighted text, i.e.,a run of text marked for reference purpose, due to its relevance in a particular context. For example it can be used in a page showing search results to highlight every instance of the searched for word.</p>
	  <p><strong>For example:</strong> Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
	
	<ol>
	    <li>In a quotation or another block, the highlighted text typically marks text that is referenced outside the quote, or marked for specific scrutiny even though the original author didn't consider it important.</li>
	    <li>In the main text, the highlighted text typically marks text that may be of special relevance for the user's current activity, like search results.</li>
	    <li>Do not use the &lt;mark> element for syntax highlighting; use the &lt;span> element for this purpose.</li>
	    <li>Do not confuse the &lt;mark> element with the &lt;strong> element. The &lt;strong> element is used to denote spans of text of importance in context of the text, when the &lt;mark> element is used to denote spans of text of relevance to a different context.</li>
         <li>Usually the color of the &lt;mark> element is yellow but you can change it using css. </li>
